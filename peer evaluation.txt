Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/Soulzippey/05-Space-shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I can't say I learned anything because it seems they did not sumbit a repository with any sort of .py file or anything really worth poring over.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
Nothing really because there is nothing here to apply to my own work.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I guess to actually write a program for the assignment.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 what happened that didn't allow them to even attempt the project.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Where it is.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes, surprisingly, this does contain an appropriate LICENSE

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 Something beyond just the literal name of the project.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I'm sure it's really great in your other projects.
